## Instructions on running our algorithm

- The [main.py](main.py) file contains our `segment_into_planes` function, which takes `parameters` dictionary as input
- The [parameters.py](parameters.py) contains the `parameters` dictionary, which contains the algorithm parameters that `segment_into_planes` function uses to run our modified RANSAC algorithm.

### Inside the `parameters` dictionary:

- change the `input_path` value to change the object that the algorithm segments into planes. We included the ob
